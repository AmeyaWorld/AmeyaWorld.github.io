Hello my name is Ameya.
I am 10 years old.
<p>With the help of my father I was able to create this website from scratch. I had nothing to do in the summer vacation, so my dad came up with the idea to learn a skill in 1.5 months. I choose coding because my dad did this as a profession and it looked fun. 

<h1>My life</h1>
<p>I was born in India. I could not remember much but I know for a fact that I loved the mango lassi there it was a type of juice. We later shifted to the Netherlands when I was 1 and a half. Of course, we visited are family in India. I started speaking Dutch which was a big accomplishment for me and my parents. Then I went to school where I started learning math’s and other subjects. Fast forward now I am in group 7.</p>

<h1>Sports and Hobbys</h1> 
<p>
My greatest passion is Running. I am very fast. I am kind of good in football but it is not really my passion. My hobbies are cooking and golf and sometimes swimming. Let’s start with cooking. I know the basics. But for sure I cannot cook Indian food I will straight up burn my arm. Golf usually calms me down. I have a relative in India who won more than 50 golf awards. I got my diploma A B C with ease if you call 3 years short. So now I do not need my dad coming with me and saying “where do you want to go next”. And no worker can say "where is your daddy/mommy" because I will just rub in their face my diploma A B C metaphorically of course although I do wish I can do that.
 </p>

<h1>Family and relatives and friends.</h1>

<p>I have talked about me now it's turns for my parents. My dad is a great dad he is actually the one who helped me make this website he means the world to me. My mom she teaches me also a lot of stuff. Let’s talk about my relatives. I have now 3 cousins.2 twins which were born very recently and a 16-year-old cousin. I have 2 grandpa's and one grandma. </p>
